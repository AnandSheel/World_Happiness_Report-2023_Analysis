                                                                          # World Happiness Report 2023
World Happiness Report released every year by UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network on International Day of Happiness. It ranks countries on the basis of the level of happiness, as measured by a range of economic, social, and political indicators. The World Happiness Index is based on two key ideas â€“ happiness or life evaluation measured through opinion surveys and identifying key elements that determine well-being and life evaluation across countries.
In this project, an analysis of the World Happiness Report 2023 dataset was conducted, exploring the relationships between happiness scores, regional trends, and key indicators such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.
The dataset was downloaded from the World Happiness Report website, which provides open access to the data and tools for analysis. By examining these relationships, insights were gained into the complex and multifaceted nature of happiness and well-being, and potential strategies for promoting happiness and improving quality of life around the world were identified.
